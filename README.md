## This is the repository I will be using for my Classification Project


### Project Goal:
- The goal of this project is to create a classification model to predict churn using the Telco data. Utilizing this predictive model I will then come up with a recommendation to prevent future churn once I have identified a driver.


### Hypothesis:
- H1: Customers in single member households within 6 months of a month-to-month contract are more likely to churn

- H0: Customers in single member households within 6 months of a month-to-month contract are equally likely to churn
